This is modification of the original Co Authors Spotlight Widget (by Thomas Faure). The original hadn't been updated in six years and this version has been updated to reflect modern coding standards. 

Like the original, this outputs multiple authors (from Co-Authors Plus plugin) in a sidebar widget, including profile picture and all meta included in profile description. 

Widget options have been reduced to Adding/Modifying the Title. 

Includes HTML In Author Bio to read HTML included in User Profile Description, then output HTML tags in widget.
